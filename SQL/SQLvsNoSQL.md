- SQL: Relational Database store data in tables are formed in row & column
- NoSQL: Key-value, graph, document

# Schema
- SQL: fixed
- NoSQL: dynamic
  
# Querying
- SQL: uses SQL (structured query language)
- NoSQL: UnQL (unstructured query language).

# Scalability
- SQL: vertically scalable. Hard to horizontally scale
- NoSQL: horizontally scalable.

# Reliability or ACID Compliancy (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- SQL: ACID compliant
- NoSQL: sacrifice ACID compliance for performance and scalability.

# SQL Normalization vs NoSQL Denormalization
- In the early stage, the hark disk drive cost very high then Denormalization consumes so much money => Now the hard disk drive cost so low
- Redundancy Data is no longer a concern
